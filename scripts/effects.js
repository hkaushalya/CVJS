var pen_text = "<H3>Key Skills</H3> I joined Tessella after finishing my \
                post-doc in high energy particle physics at Fermilab. While at \
                Tessella I worked on number of different projects for both \
                pharmaceutical and oil and gas industry and learned new skills \
                in the process. I have experience working with both waterfall \
                and agile methodologies.  I work well both independently and \
                as part of wider teams and has an excellent background working \
                closely with clients to understand their needs and requirements. \
                I have worked on several international scientific research \
                projects that used terabytes of particle collision data. \
                I contributed to the data acquisition, data cleaning, \
                data transformation, and data analysis work in these \
                collaborations. Through these research projects I mastered \
                object-oriented programming and gained experience in C++, \
                Python, R, and HTML. Presenting my work at international \
                conferences and collaboration meetings I have developed \
                excellent communication skills. I enjoy learning new \
                technologies and using them to solve complex problems.";

<h2>Suggestions for Social Content Tagging</h2> \
- February - March 2015 <br> \
- Skills: Requirement Gathering, Natural Language Processing, Python <br> \
- Using historical data generate suggestions for users to tag social contents. \
Provide analysis of frequent tag words, possible duplicates and spell corrections for the administrators. <br> \
<h2>&#39What if Analysis&#39 Tool for Sales</h2> \
- January - February 2015 <br> \
- Skills: Requirement Gathering, Mathematics, Forecasting, Issue Tracking (JIRA), VB , Visual Studio <br> \
- Automated collection and import of sales records and perform &#39What If Analysis&#39 \
for different scenarios by generating summary reports and charts by sectors, \
divisions and for the company. <br> \
<h2> Clinical Trial Data Accrual and Planning Tool</h2> \
- November - December 2014 <br> \
- Skills: Agile Development, Team work, Unit Testing, Development Testing, \
Deployment Testing, Issue Tracking (JIRA), C#, Visual Studio <br> \
- Worked as part of a Tessella team carrying out a project for a global \
Pharmaceutical company.  Designed and developed unit testing and system \
testing for the trial data accrual and decision planning simulation tools. \
These tools visualize and simulate the impact of availability of data on \
certain aspects of clinical trial&#39s design and proper sample size for a \
learning phase trial. Scrum project management under Agile development \
framework was used with 3 sprints to deliver final product in 1.5 months. <br> \
<h2>MS Office Data Migration Tool</h2> \
- November - December 2014<br> \
- Skills: VB, Visual Studio, User Interface Design, Client Management<br> \
- Worked on a project for a major oil & gas company.  Developed code base \
and a user interface to extract information from PowerPoint presentation into \
MS Office products. The design had to be simple, intuitive and able to handle \
various user scenarios. Choice of technology was based on client requirement \
and the finish product was delivered in one week.<br> \
<h2>Data Analyses and Operations Support for CMS Collaboration at LHC</h2> \
- June 2011 - October 2014<br> \
- Skills: C++, Python, HTML, Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, Statistics, \
CVS, GIT, Grid Computing (LHCG, HTCondor)<br> \
- Developed several high performance code bases to isolate rare events and \
measure their physics properties. OOP design techniques were used to develop \
code and share with international collaborators. They were designed to scale, \
rapidly evolve and optimized for faster processing.<br> \
- Developed plugins to isolate spurious DAQ events from data streams.  \
The isolation criteria needed to be robust and efficient. Plugins needed \
be portable across different versions of internal software versions.<br> \
- Developed and administered software validation tools for the collaboration. \
Internal software framework was rapidly evolving to adjust to the detector \
conditions and incorporating new features. But the physics contents must \
remain consistent. For this, implemented a visualization using Java Script to \
summarize consistency of fundamental physics measurements in new software builds. <br> \
<h2>Data Analyses and Operations Support for CDF Collaboration at Fermilab</h2> \
- June 2005 - May 2011 <br> \
- Skills: C++, C, Java, HTML, Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, Statistics, \
CVS, Grid Computing (HTCondor) <br> \
- Developed a several high performance code base to isolate rare events and \
measure their physics properties. OOP design techniques were used to develop \
code and share with international collaborators. It was designed to scale, \
rapidly evolve and optimized for faster processing. Developed new data \
structures to speed up processing time. <br> \
- Developed Java based user interface for the collaboration to load different \
design patterns to logic boards. It can be run in command line mode which was \
crucial for collaborators working remotely. The new program reduced the data \
recording downtime by half. <br> \
- Developed highly customizable tools in Bash/Csh to query computer grid. <br> \
